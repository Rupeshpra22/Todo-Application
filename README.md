# Todo-Application
Basic Todo Application using HTML,CSS,Javascript

Things that i learned from this project:

1: DOM Manipulation

2: How to create an element, how to add classes and style to element, how to append child, how to get the child and parent element.

3: LocalStorage in Javascript

I have followed this youtube video:

Other than following the video, i have also made this application full responsive.

If you are a beginner, go give a try, this will clear your some basic concept of Javascript.

Cheers!!!
